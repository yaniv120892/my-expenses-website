# My Expenses

Personal expense management: transaction tracking with AI-powered
categorization, bulk imports from credit-card statements, scheduled and
recurring transactions, subscription detection, trends, Telegram bot, and a
streaming AI chat assistant — all in a single Next.js application that serves
both the web UI and the API.

## Stack

- **App**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19 + MUI 7 + TanStack Query 5
- **API**: Next.js route handlers under `src/app/api`, business logic in
  `src/server`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma (Accelerate for the app,
  field-level encryption for sensitive columns)
- **Auth**: JWT (jose) in an httpOnly cookie + Upstash Redis sessions
- **AI**: Mastra agent (chat assistant with tools + PG memory), OpenAI or
  Gemini via `AI_PROVIDER`, plus an external FastText categorizer service
- **Observability**: pino structured logs, Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in values
npm run db:migrate     # applies prisma/migrations via DIRECT_URL
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

`DATABASE_URL` must be a Prisma Accelerate URL (`prisma://…`); `DIRECT_URL`
is the plain Postgres connection used by migrations, the e2e seed, and the
assistant's memory store. For local development `npx prisma dev` provides a
compatible local setup.

## Scripts

| Script                                  | What it does                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`                           | Dev server (Turbopack)                          |
| `npm run build`                         | `prisma generate && next build`                 |
| `npm run typecheck` / `lint` / `format` | Quality gates (also run pre-commit)             |
| `npm run db:migrate`                    | `prisma migrate deploy`                         |
| `npm run test:e2e:api`                  | API/chat harness — see `test/e2e-api/README.md` |
| `npm run test:e2e:ui`                   | Playwright specs in `e2e/`                      |

## Deployment (Vercel)

- `vercel-build` runs migrations before `next build`
- Cron jobs are declared in `vercel.json`; set `CRON_SECRET` in the project
  env or the cron routes will reject Vercel's invocations
- Register the Telegram webhook once per environment:
  `https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/setWebhook?url=<WEBSITE_URL>/api/webhook&secret_token=<TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET>`
- Logs: pino JSON to stdout — attach a Vercel Log Drain (e.g. Better Stack)
  to ship them; no in-app log shipping. Errors are logged, not sent to an
  error tracker; cron routes throw on partial failure so a failed run shows
  up as a non-2xx in Vercel's cron history

## External services

| Service                  | Contract                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| expense-categorizer      | `POST ${EXPENSE_CATEGORIZER_BASE_URL}/predict` `{description}` → category + confidence                                  |
| excel-extraction-service | `POST ${EXCEL_EXTRACTION_AGENT_URL}/api/extract`; result arrives at `/api/excel-extraction-agent/webhook` (HMAC-signed) |

## History

The backend previously lived in the now-deprecated
[my-expenses](https://github.com/yaniv120892/my-expenses) repository and was
consolidated here — route handlers replaced Express, class-validator DTOs
became zod schemas, and all external clients construct lazily (serverless-safe).
